**[Firebase](https://firebase.com/)** is a popular choice for React Native projects as it provides a range of tools and services that can be used to build robust, scalable, and secure mobile applications. Some of the key Firebase services that are used in this project are:

* **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging allows developers to send notifications and messages to mobile devices, web applications, and desktop clients.
* **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics provides insights into user behavior and app performance. It tracks various metrics, such as user engagement, retention, and conversion, and provides real-time reporting.

First of all, go to the **[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)** and create a new project.
