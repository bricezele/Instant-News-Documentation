# iOS Setup

Steps to sync an iOS project with Firebase:

Once you have created a new project, you can add an iOS app to it.

You'll need to provide a bundle identifier for your app.

![Create a new iOS Firebase step 2](/img/app-setup/firebase-setup-ios-step-2.png)

Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist file, which contains the necessary configuration details for your app to connect with Firebase.

Move the downloaded google-services.json file into the InstantNews/ directory of your iOS project.

That's it! Your iOS project should now be synced with Firebase, and you should be able to use Firebase services (Analytics, Push notifications) in your app.
