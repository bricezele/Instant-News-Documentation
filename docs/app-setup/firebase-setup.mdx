# Firebase Setup

:::caution

This project cannot work without firebase

:::

**[Firebase](https://firebase.com/)** is a popular choice for React Native projects as it provides a range of tools and services that can be used to build robust, scalable, and secure mobile applications. Some of the key Firebase services that are used in this project are:

* **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging allows developers to send notifications and messages to mobile devices, web applications, and desktop clients.
* **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics provides insights into user behavior and app performance. It tracks various metrics, such as user engagement, retention, and conversion, and provides real-time reporting.

First of all, go to the **[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)** and create a new project.

## Android Setup

To allow the Android app to securely connect to your Firebase project, a configuration file must be downloaded and added to your project.

### Generating Android credentials

On the Firebase console, add a new Android application and enter your projects details. The "Android package name" must match your local projects package name which can be found inside of the `manifest` tag within the `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file within your project.


## Step 2: Link your project with Sentry

### Automatically

Run @sentry/wizard
```bash
npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android
```

### Manually
