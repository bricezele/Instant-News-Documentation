**[Sentry](https://sentry.io/)** is a cloud-based error tracking platform that helps developers to monitor and debug their applications. It provides real-time insights into errors and exceptions occurring in the application, allowing developers to quickly diagnose and fix issues. Sentry supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including React Native.

If you don't want to use Sentry for this project, you can disable it in `.env` file:
